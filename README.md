# :hammer_and_wrench: Building...

- The idea of this proyect is building code to recycle.
- Also... practice, practice, practice.

## :infinity: About this counter

- Aesthetic color pallette and great UX, done in ReactJS.
- Mobile-first.
- Material UI as a component library.
- Motion UI to animate the components.

### :gear: Yet to implement...

- A brief description of the project in "About".
- A contact form in "Contact".
- Allow user to slide the counter icons to increase/decrease the count.
- Some blobbity blob animations around the background.
- Gradient progress bar (maybe liquid?) showing distance to next checkpoint.
- Cheering the user when he gets to 25, 50 and 100 in the count.
- Animate the count reset.
